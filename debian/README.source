As suggest by upstream [0], Debian uses all-in-one CJK super OTC font for
fonts-noto-cjk package. All other font formats are not used in Debian.

In upstream GitHub release [1], all font formats are in single release tarball.
Since Debian only needs NotoSansCJK.ttc (all-in-one CJK super OTC font), the
repack tarball strips all other font files.
